# EMG Classifier
----------------

A GUI program for Matlab to analyze and classify an incoming EMG signal. The program reads a single channel through an audio input, analyzes it, and displays information about it.

#### To do:

- The actual classification algorithm.
- Additional options to sample and process the input signal.
- A GUI segway for training the classifier.
- Ability to input files or export/import training data.
- Ability to interface with our final EMG device through Bluetooth.
